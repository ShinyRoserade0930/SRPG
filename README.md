TODO:
UI is crappy. Will fix.
Add InfoCheckingState to check units' skill and stats.
Currently hero is pre-equipped with a cursed blade(which applies poison to user). Will improve equipment system to let players interact with.
Add overworld system to travel between stages. Not designed yet.
Enemy bots are dumb. No idea how to fix yet.
