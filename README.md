My wip SRPG project for personal learning.

No Application.Quit() yet. Please exit yourself (e.g. with Task Manager).

This build has 3 units with different movements (walk, fly, teleport).

Use WASD or arrow keys to move the selector. Mouse click will fire a command to either select the unit or move to the selected tile.
